# Cerberus — Cross-Domain Threat Intelligence Platform

> **Live Document** — Update this skill as the project evolves. This is the canonical reference for architecture, data model, hackathon framing, and implementation status.

## Project Context

- **Hackathon:** HackWithBay 2.0
- **Theme:** Thoughtful Agents for Productivity
- **Team:** 2 people
- **Timeline:** 8 hours on-site + 2-3 days polish
- **Sponsors:** Neo4j (primary DB), RocketRide AI (orchestration), Juspay (financial signals)

## One-Line Pitch

> Cerberus is a thoughtful security agent that eliminates the 4-hour manual graph-traversal process of tracing cross-domain attack chains — it reasons about which domains to query, connects the signals no single-surface tool can see, and learns from analyst feedback to get faster with every investigation.

## Architecture Overview

```
INPUT LAYER (GitHub URL / npm package / IP / domain / Juspay ID)
       ↓
ROCKETRIDE PIPELINE ("thoughtful agent")
  Webhook → NER → Text Classification → Route Decision
       ↓
  MCP Client → neo4j-mcp server (write-cypher / read-cypher)
       ↓
  LLM Node (Anthropic) — graph context → threat narrative
       ↓
  Text Output → SSE stream to frontend
       ↓
SELF-IMPROVEMENT LOOP
  Confirmed patterns → labeled subgraph → cache hits skip LLM
       ↓
FRONTEND (React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + neovis.js)
```

## Key Tech Stack

## Neo4j Schema

### Node Labels

| Label | Key Property | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `Package` | name (UNIQUE) | npm registry |
| `CVE` | id (UNIQUE) | NVD/MITRE |
| `IP` | address (UNIQUE) | threat intel feeds |
| `Domain` | name (UNIQUE) | DNS/WHOIS |
| `ThreatActor` | name (UNIQUE) | MITRE ATT&CK |
| `Technique` | mitre_id (UNIQUE) | MITRE ATT&CK STIX |
| `Account` | (username, registry) UNIQUE | npm/GitHub |
| `FraudSignal` | juspay_id (UNIQUE) | Juspay API |

### Relationships

```
(:Package)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(:Package)
(:Package)-[:HAS_VULNERABILITY]->(:CVE)
(:Package)-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(:Account)
(:CVE)-[:EXPLOITED_BY]->(:ThreatActor)
(:ThreatActor)-[:USES]->(:Technique)

```

### ⚠ Synthetic Data: Account → IP

No public source maps npm publishers to IPs. These links are simulated for demo. Render with **dashed edges** in visualization.

**Judge answer:** "The Account-to-IP link is simulated from threat intel correlation. In production, this would come from Git commit metadata, npm publish audit logs, or SIEM data."

## Demo Entity: ua-parser-js

Primary demo target. Hijacked Oct 2021 — versions 0.7.29, 0.8.0, 1.0.0 contained cryptomining + credential-stealing malware. CVE-2021-27292 (ReDoS). Fallback demo: `colors` v1.4.1 sabotage.

## RocketRide Pipelines

1. **cerberus-ingest** — Raw input → NER → classify → write to graph
2. **cerberus-query** — Entity → reason → route → traverse → narrate → learn
3. **cerberus-juspay** (stretch) — Juspay fraud alerts → enrich graph

## Self-Improvement Loop

| Phase | State | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (empty) | No prior patterns | Full LLM analysis, ~8s |
| 2 (seeded) | MITRE + CVE imported | Shorter prompts, ~5s |
| 3 (confirmed) | Analyst-confirmed patterns | Cache hit, skip LLM, ~2s |

## User Stories

### Core Investigation Flow

- **US-1: Package investigation** — As a security analyst, I can paste an npm package name (e.g., `ua-parser-js`) and get back a cross-domain attack chain showing how that package connects to threat actors, malicious IPs, and fraud signals — so I don't have to manually correlate across Snyk, Shodan, and fraud dashboards.
- **US-2: IP investigation** — As a security analyst, I can submit a suspicious IP address and see which threat actors operate from it, which domains it hosts, which packages it's linked to, and whether it appears in fraud signals — giving me full infrastructure context in one query.
- **US-3: Domain investigation** — As a security analyst, I can submit a domain and trace it to hosting IPs, threat actors who control it, and any packages it serves — revealing supply-chain attack infrastructure.
- **US-4: Streaming narrative** — As a security analyst, I can watch an AI-generated threat narrative stream in real time as the pipeline runs, explaining the cross-domain attack chain in plain language with specific node names and relationship types — so I can brief stakeholders without manually writing reports.

### Visible Agent Reasoning

- **US-5: Pipeline stage visibility** — As a user, I can see each pipeline stage (NER → Classify → Route → Graph → Analyze → Narrate) light up as it executes — so I understand what the agent is doing and trust it's reasoning, not just spinning.
- **US-6: Route decision** — As a user, I can see which cross-domain traversal the agent chose (software→infra, infra→financial, full cross-domain) and why — reinforcing the "Thoughtful Agent" theme.

### Self-Improvement Loop

- **US-7: Analyst confirmation** — As a security analyst, I can confirm a threat pattern the agent found, which tags the subgraph as a known pattern — so future queries on the same chain are instant.
- **US-8: Cache hit skip** — As a returning user, when I query an entity whose attack chain was previously confirmed, the system returns the cached result instantly (~2s) without calling the LLM — proving the agent learns from feedback.
- **US-9: Progressive improvement** — As a demo viewer, I can see eval output showing Phase 1 (empty, ~8s) → Phase 2 (seeded, ~5s) → Phase 3 (confirmed, ~2s) with assertions passing — proving the system measurably improves.

### Graph Visualization

- **US-10: Interactive graph** — As a user, I can see the attack chain rendered as a color-coded force-directed graph (Package=blue, CVE=red, IP=orange, ThreatActor=purple, FraudSignal=yellow) with the traversal path highlighted.
- **US-11: Synthetic edge distinction** — As a user, I can distinguish real data from synthetic data because Account→IP links render with dashed edges.
- **US-12: Node inspection** — As a user, I can click any node in the graph to see its properties in a sidebar.

### Data Ingestion

- **US-13: Seed data import** — As a developer, I can run the import scripts to populate the graph with ~200 MITRE techniques, ~100 groups, ~50 CVEs, ~100 malicious IPs, ~30 compromised packages, and ~20 synthetic fraud signals — enough for a compelling demo.
- **US-14: Live entity ingestion** — As a user, when I submit a new entity, the ingest pipeline extracts entities via NER, classifies the threat type, and writes new nodes/relationships to the graph — so the knowledge base grows with use.

### Comparison / Demo

- **US-15: Split-screen comparison** — As a demo viewer, I can see a side-by-side of Cerberus's multi-domain graph vs `npm audit` output for the same package — making it viscerally clear that single-surface tools miss cross-domain attack chains.

## Critical Gotchas

- **APOC availability:** Test `RETURN apoc.version()` hour 1. If missing, `get-schema` won't work — use `read-cypher` with manual schema queries.
- **neovis.js credentials:** Always proxy through backend. Never expose Neo4j creds in frontend JS.
- **Cypher patterns:** Always use `shortestPath` + directed patterns. Never unbounded undirected traversals.
- **Node IDs:** Use domain keys (`{name: $startName}`), never `id()` internal IDs.
- **Uniqueness constraints:** Run ALL 8 constraints before ANY import.

## Environment Variables

```
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://<aura-instance>
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<password>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...            # Anthropic API key
NEO4J_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787    # MCP server (optional, has default)
ROCKETRIDE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000   # RocketRide (optional, has default)
CERBERUS_API=http://localhost:8000
```

⚠️ ~~Known issue: `backend/config.py` reads `ANTHROPIC_KEY` from `NEO4J_API_KEY` env var~~ — VERIFIED FALSE. `ANTHROPIC_KEY = _require("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")` is correct.

## Backend API (FastAPI)

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check → `{"status": "ok"}` |
| GET | `/api/schema` | Live graph schema (labels, rel types, counts) |
| POST | `/api/query` | Main query: cache check → traverse → LLM narrative |
| GET | `/api/query/stream` | SSE streaming version of query endpoint |
| POST | `/api/confirm` | Analyst confirms threat pattern → write-back (returns count + message) |
| GET | `/api/graph` | Force-directed graph data (nodes + edges) for vis |
| POST | `/api/demo/natural` | NLP entity extraction from free-text |
| POST | `/api/demo/compare` | Multi-entity comparison (side-by-side) |
| GET | `/api/demo/feed` | Synthetic fraud event stream |
| POST | `/api/demo/feed/ingest` | Upsert fraud signals into graph |
| GET | `/api/demo/map` | Geo-IP map data (lat/lng points) |
| GET | `/api/demo/report` | Full investigation report (Juspay summary) |

### Query Pipeline Flow

```
Input: entity + type (package/ip/domain/cve/threatactor)
  ↓
Cache hit? → YES → Return cached narrative (no LLM, ~2s)
  ↓ NO
Graph traversal (domain-routed Cypher)
  ↓
Paths found? → NO → Generic "not found" message
  ↓ YES
LLM narrative generation (Claude, 600 tokens max)
  ↓
Write-back: tag nodes with analysis timestamp
  ↓
Return response
```

### Key Backend Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/main.py` | FastAPI app, CORS, lifespan, schema endpoint |
| `backend/config.py` | Env var loader with validation |
| `backend/neo4j_client.py` | Neo4j driver wrapper, traversal, cache/confirm, graph viz, geo, Juspay |
| `backend/llm.py` | Anthropic Claude narrative generation (blocking + streaming) |
| `backend/rocketride.py` | RocketRide pipeline integration (async httpx, SSE proxy, 60s timeout) |
| `backend/models.py` | Pydantic models: EntityType, QueryRequest, ConfirmRequest |
| `backend/routes/query.py` | POST /api/query + GET /api/query/stream (uses rocketride fallback) |
| `backend/routes/confirm.py` | POST /api/confirm (returns confirmed count + message) |
| `backend/routes/demo.py` | Demo APIs: NLP, comparison, feed, map, report |

## RocketRide Pipeline Definitions

Pipeline YAML configs live in `pipelines/`:

| File | Purpose | Key Nodes |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `cerberus-ingest.yaml` | Raw input → NER → classify → Neo4j write | webhook → NER (Claude Haiku 4.5) → classifier → cypher-builder → neo4j-write |
| `cerberus-query.yaml` | Thoughtful agent query pipeline | chat → NER → classifier → cache-check → branch → traverse → LLM → write-back |
| `cerberus-juspay.yaml` | Juspay fraud signal ingestion (stretch) | webhook → parser → validator → neo4j-write-fraud → neo4j-enrich |

## Test Suite

Three test files in `tests/`:

| File | Coverage |
|------|---------|
| `test_api_routes.py` | API routes with mocked Neo4j/LLM (health, query cache hit/miss/empty, confirm) |
| `test_import_scripts.py` | Data parsing logic, integrity checks (MITRE, CVE, npm, synthetic, threats) |
| `test_neo4j_client.py` | Entity routing, Cypher template rendering, cache/traverse/confirm logic |

**97 tests passing** as of latest push.

## Frontend Architecture

### State Machine (useInvestigation.ts)

SSE stream from `GET /api/query/stream`:
```
idle → running → complete
         ↓
SSE events:
  {"stage": "ner"}    → pipeline stage indicator
  {"stage": "traverse"}
  {"paths_found": N}  → graph metadata  
  {"text": "chunk"}   → narrative chunks
  "[DONE]"            → stream complete
```

Pipeline stages rendered in UI: `input → ner → classify → route → traverse → analyze → narrate → complete`

### Panel Components

| Panel | Features |
|-------|---------|
| `QueryPanel` | NLP free-text input, entity type pills, live fraud feed carousel, quick-start buttons |
| `NarrativePanel` | Streaming text animation, confirm button, PDF export, comparison mode |
| `GraphPanel` | Force-directed graph (d3-force), geo IP map, node color painters, legends |

### API Client (api.ts)

12 typed functions including: `queryEntity()`, `queryStream()`, `confirmEntity()`, `getSchema()`, `getGraph()`, `demoNatural()`, `demoCompare()`, `demoFeed()`, `demoMap()`, `demoReport()`, `ingestFraudSignals()`, `getJuspaySummary()`.

Base URL hardcoded as `http://localhost:8000` — uses the backend's CORS `allow_origins=["*"]`.

## RocketRide Integration (rocketride.py)

Backend integrates with RocketRide AI for pipeline orchestration:
- **Async httpx client** with 60s timeout for pipeline execution
- **SSE proxy** — streams pipeline events from RocketRide to frontend
- **Graceful fallback** — if RocketRide is unavailable, falls back to direct LLM narrative generation
- Used by `query.py` via `rocketride.generate_narrative_or_fallback()`

## Docker Setup

### Architecture

| Service | Image | Port | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| `neo4j-mcp` | Alpine 3.20 + pre-built binary | 8787 | HTTP mode, per-request Basic Auth |
| `backend` | Python 3.12-slim | 8000 | Build context = project root |
| `frontend` | Node 20-alpine (multi-stage) | 5173 (dev) / 80 (prod) | Dev: hot-reload, Prod: nginx |

### Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env           # fill in Neo4j Aura + Anthropic creds
docker compose up --build      # starts all 3 services
```

### Docker Gotchas

1. **neo4j-mcp in HTTP mode** — In HTTP transport mode, Neo4j credentials must NOT be set as env vars on the MCP container. They're passed per-request via Basic Auth headers from the backend.
2. **Backend build context** — Set to project root (`.`) not `./backend`, because `requirements.txt` lives at root. Dockerfile is at `backend/Dockerfile`.
3. **neo4j-mcp binary** — The Darwin (macOS) binary won't work in Linux containers. A separate `neo4j-mcp_Linux_arm64/` directory contains the Linux binary + its own Dockerfile.
4. **neo4j-mcp CLI flags** — v1.5.0 uses `--neo4j-transport-mode`, `--neo4j-http-port`, `--neo4j-http-host` (not `--transport`, `--port`, `--host`).
5. **neo4j-mcp healthcheck** — No GET health endpoint. The `/mcp` endpoint returns 405 on GET (only accepts POST), which we grep for to confirm the server is alive.
6. **Frontend multi-stage** — docker-compose targets the `dev` stage. For production: `docker build --target prod -t cerberus-frontend frontend/` uses nginx with SPA routing.
7. **VITE_API_URL** — Baked into JS bundle at build time for prod stage. Dev uses env var.
- [ ] End-to-end integration tested with real Anthropic API key
- [ ] Demo rehearsed + pre-cached

## Known Issues

1. ~~config.py semantic mismatch~~ — VERIFIED FALSE. Config is correct (`ANTHROPIC_KEY = _require("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")`)
2. ~~neo4j_client.py unused import~~ — VERIFIED FALSE. hashlib IS used in write_back() for narrative_hash
3. ~~neo4j_client.py Cypher templating~~ — Still uses `.format()` for labels/keys but mitigated by enum routing
4. **CORS wide open:** `allow_origins=["*"]` in main.py — acceptable for hackathon, note for judges
5. ~~Duplicate import scripts~~ — CONSOLIDATED. `scripts/` is now the single source of truth
6. ~~Unbounded shortestPath~~ — FIXED. All Cypher queries now use `[*..6]` or `[*..5]` bounds
7. ~~_WRITE_BACK Cypher bug~~ — FIXED. `start` variable now carried through WITH clause
8. ~~Missing LLM error handling~~ — FIXED. Query route gracefully returns graph data when LLM unavailable
9. ~~Bad model name~~ — FIXED. Changed from `claude-opus-4-6` to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
10. **FastAPI version:** Requires FastAPI ≥0.115.0 (incompatible with older Starlette 0.46+)
